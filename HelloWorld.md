Hello Coursera classmates.  

Hi, my name is Marc Vaglio-Laurin.  I live in Cary, NC (just outside of Raleigh).  I’m married (20 years), have a son in high school (who is just starting to drive), and a daughter in middle school.

I recently began working as an Analytics Consultant for Statistica, following their acquisition by the Dell Software Group.

Until early this year, I worked at SAS Institute. During my time at SAS, I watched analytics progress from a ‘back room’ function to a discipline that is now recognized and embraced as a sophisticated means for gaining competitive advantage in many industries and functional areas.

A couple of years ago, I decided it was time to learn more than just SAS.  To me, learning R in a structured manner is a big appeal of this program.

I fully expect to learn in the virtual classroom from recognized thought leaders in the field of predictive analytics, as well as from my virtual classmates, which will provide me with a broader knowledge and expertise of predictive analytics.

I like to consider myself a 'lifelong learner'.  I have an MBA from Duke University and an MS from Northwestern.  I definitely plan to pursue a doctorate at some point in the near future.

Looking forward to getting to know you all better during this course!
